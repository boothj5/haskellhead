Implementation of shithead (tractor boy rules) in Haskell

Currently just messing about with data types until I've actaully finshed the haskell book.  It wont do anything at the moment, it's just a bunch of functions to run in GHCI

It will eventually have the same functionality as the java version shithead.git
